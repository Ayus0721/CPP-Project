#  BANK MANAGEMENT

 In this project, I'm using Two classes they are:
# - Customer class
- Define a Customer class to store customer information such as name, account number, and balance.
- Implement methods to create a new customer account, update customer details, and retrieve customer information.
# - Bank class
- Define a Bank class to manage customer accounts and transactions.
- Implement methods to add new customers, open accounts, close accounts, and perform other bank-related operations.

# Why using std::vector?
- Here the number of customer is not fixed so using " std::vector " allows us to remove customers dynamically without worrying about the size of container
- It provides convenient methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements, making it suitable for storing a collection of customer objects
